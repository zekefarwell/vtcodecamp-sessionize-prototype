    <p> I am Associate Professor at Champlain College teaching introductory and advanced Web, MIS, Economics and Finance courses.
After I attained my Master’s Degree from Fordham University in the early 1980&#39;s, I began my career as a financial analyst on Wall Street. There I developed financial models using the first IBM AT and XT computers.  After leaving Wall Street, I began my career teaching Economics, Computer Applications and Web Programming. My interests in Web technology includes Systems Analysis, XML, PHP, JavaScript, database development and the business of technological innovation. In economics my interests include economic development, commodities market pricing and financial derivatives as well as international finance and trade.
In 2006, I co-authored my first book with noted author Patrick Carey, “New Perspectives on JavaScript Programming”. I am currently working on a series of economics books for the economics-non-major as well books on database design, statistical analysis of big data and the financial analysis of technological innovation.
Realizing that economics and not technology was my passion, I went back for a PhD in Economics at Fordham University. I began in the Program in 2006 and graduated in May of 2015. It is while in this program I feel I really grew as a student, instructor and as a person. I was placed on academic probation twice and twice I came out stronger and better. What allowed me to be successful was realizing I needed to tab into a huge resource: my professors. When I did that I not was never on probation again. Had I done this sooner I really believe I would never have been on probation in the first place. Their insights and mentoring were a huge reason why I completed the Program.
On the lighter side of things, I live in Williston, Vermont. I also enjoy hunting, golf and playing chess. I love sports and I am an avid Mets fan. I also love the Yankees, Jets, Giants, the Islanders, the Rangers, the Nets and the Knicks. You must be wondering how can I route for these combinations of teams? I just love sports and enjoy routing for my NY teams. Since moving to Vermont in the 1990’s I have become an avid UVM basketball fan.

Currently I am the first Data Innovation Fellow for the Vermont Center of Geographic Information and the organizer of this joint geospatial and data science conference, GeoDatSci. Each of these experiences taught me the importance of data-driven decision making and creating compelling stories.

Self-taught in R and Python for data science, machine learning and visualization, I have published articles in Medium and led local Data Scientist Meetups to help others. For me the merging of my fine art and design skills into data analysis, visualization and 3D modelling is a natural progression and reflects the field’s direction in general.  </p>
