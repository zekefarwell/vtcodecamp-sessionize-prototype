        <p> Machine learning and data science are in popular demand. Predictive model deployment is the part of the machine learning process where the practical results are achieved. Model deployment is the process of making a machine learning model available for generating predictions on new data, known as scoring (or sometimes called inferencing). The deployment used to present big difficulties, as models were typically built in one environment and needed to be deployed in a different one. Often they would need to be re-implemented in a new programming language, that would be very slow and error-prone.
This talk will cover two open standards that have made the process of model deployment easier: Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) and Portable Format for Analytics (PFA), both developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG). We&#39;ll also talk briefly about deployment options for deep learning models.

It is the perfect framework to develop the the Web APIs that drive the hottest web and mobile apps. The key is to have the right architecture to go along with the benefits that ASP.NET Core gives developers. In this , we will look at ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web API and the Hexagonal Architecture to allow your APIs to be efficient and testable.

By using the Hex Architecture not only does the development story become easier but your end users get a much more stable API set to consume. The talk will explain and get you started on using these concepts with your ASP.NET Core 2.0 Web API projects. </p>

        <p> As someone that first started exploring Python for data analytics it was a pleasant surprise to find that the same language can be used for 3D modeling software like Blender, Maya, Poser and Rhino. Translating programing abilities into creating printed objects or virtual models can extend how the coding can be used to make an impact, solve a problem or tell a story in a completely novel way.

The talk will cover explorations of geospatial and abstract data represented as 3D models to create new ways of visualizing information including printing incredibly accurate  geospatial Lidar DEM and DSM models at multiple scales and creating abstracted models of complex data in VR environments.

        <p> Azure Functions, Microsoft’s serverless offering, allow developers to focus on their code and not be concerned  infrastructure or DevOps. And thanks to a slew of built-in integrations, it&#39;s also easy to have your functions get and send data to various services or even be triggered by events in those services. One such integration is with Azure Cosmos DB, the multi-model, globally distributed NoSQL data service. Cosmos DB exposes data as documents that you can access via SQL, JavaScript MongoDB or Cassandra as well as graph and key-value store. In this session, you&#39;ll see how easily you can build an API from a set of Azure Functions that interact with Cosmos DB documents and some other services. We’ll go all cross-platform with Visual Studio Code and NodeJS. </p>

        <p> A major undertaking is going on around the world: standardizing the way companies and governmental agencies communicate about pharmaceutical products.  One component of this system is ginas (Global Ingredients Archiving System), a software system that allows users to define the substances used in medicines, foods, veterinary products, etc. with sufficient precision so that people around the world can communicate confidently about these substances, eliminating the errors that come with ambiguity.

One component of ginas is a set of tools for Microsoft Excel that allow retrieval of information from a ginas repository into a spreadsheet as well as entry of new information into a repository from a spreadsheet.

The tools consist of a C# user interface that communicates with a Java RESTful web service via a JavaScript shim.  Users can create reports by retrieving data to match a query name or identifier; create new worksheets for data entry; and post new data to a server. The new data may be brand new records; new names or identifiers for existing records; amendments to existing outward links and other updates.

We will start with an overview of the standardization process, then talk about the ginas system as an implementation of the new standards.   This will set the context the Excel tools, which we&#39;ll dissect in detail.  Finally, the lessons learned about Excel add-ins that may be relevant to developers of similar add-ins. </p>

        <p> Successful integration of software applications depends critically on appropriate sharing of data.  But how do we know what constitutes “appropriate” data sharing?  By talking to your users, and asking targeted questions to assess their expectations around the addition, modification, and viewing of data, as well as what rules your users believe should govern access to specific data points, you will be able to anticipate and plan for key software architecture decisions.  

You will learn how to:

*Characterize the way your users currently think about data in relation to multiple products 
*Establish the way that your users’ tasks could be better supported by alternative underlying data models
*Reveal which users need to see what data and in what circumstances (e.g. permissions)
*Anticipate areas where data sharing is deemed risky by users, and explore potential data verification strategies to mitigate risk
*Investigate user conceptions of data at an enterprise level and resulting implications for data manipulation at the child level </p>

        <p> Successful systems continue to evolve through changing features, technologies and developers. Let&#39;s discuss how to evaluate changes and impacts on the technical debt of systems. Should we follow Conway&#39;s law? Reverse Conway&#39;s law? What are some metrics to monitor, so that we don&#39;t have to declare technical bankruptcy. </p>

        <p> Every company delivers value at some level as their primary mission, yet many don&#39;t have a clear picture of how the do it and how they can do it better and more efficiently.   This is especially tricky in the rapidly changing world of software development.    We&#39;ll walk through why value stream mapping is important and some actual value streams covering some lessons learned and examples of reducing waste and making value delivery more efficient and the primary focus. </p>

        </h4>

        <p> We&#39;ve never had time to Test All The Things before releasing updates to production. So how can we feel confident to release updates weekly or even daily with continuous delivery (CD)? Automating regression tests is already a challenge. What about all the other critical testing activities we need to do to make sure our product doesn&#39;t turn into a roadblock for customers?
In this session, Lisa will introduce some new tools and frameworks that will help your team work together to overcome testing challenges and succeed with CD. These include: 
* Ways to visualize your CD pipeline so the team can find ways to shorten feedback loops and mitigate risks
* How to use a test suite canvas to discuss what questions each step in your CD pipeline needs to answer, to understand the value each step provides
* How to make sure all essential types of testing are done continually, and how to fit testing into the continuous world. 
There IS a “test” in DevOps! Let’s explore it together. </p>

We’ll finish off by looking at a demo or two and how this all fits into the grand scheme of the IoT. </p>

        <p> Leadership is a fascinating social phenomenon that occurs in all groups of people regardless of geography, culture or nationality. Most young people today aspire to become leaders in school, entertainment, politics or any other area of endeavor. 
For a leader to be continuously effective over time and in different situations, the leader&#39;s behavior must vary with the situation. But how do we know if the leader is effective and is making ethical decisions for the organization? In the session I will talk about the ethical issues that leaders face today and provide information to enable a leader to effectively carry out the leadership process.
