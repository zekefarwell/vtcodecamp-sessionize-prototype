Predictive model deployment is the part of the machine learning process where the practical results are achieved. Model deployment is the process of making a machine learning model available for generating predictions on new data, known as scoring (or sometimes called inferencing). The deployment used to present big difficulties, as models were typically built in one environment and needed to be deployed in a different one. Often they would need to be re-implemented in a new programming language, that would be very slow and error-prone.\r\nThis talk will cover two open standards that have made the process of model deployment easier: Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) and Portable Format for Analytics (PFA), both developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG). We'll also talk briefly about deployment options for deep learning models.\r\n","startsAt":"2018-09-15T13:45:00","endsAt":"2018-09-15T14:45:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":["01f67d55-1faa-461b-836f-c931a49a9164"],"categoryItems":[7545,7541],"questionAnswers":[],"roomId":2325,"format":"60 minutes","level":"200 (never stop learning)","timeslotId":1345,"link":"/sessions/#61632"},"room":{"id":2325,"name":"Room 221 - Data: From Big to Small","sort":1},"speakers":[{"id":"01f67d55-1faa-461b-836f-c931a49a9164","firstName":"Svetlana","lastName":"Levitan","bio":"Svetlana is a Developer Advocate with IBM Center for Open Data and Artificial Intelligence Technology.

There I developed financial models using the first IBM AT and XT computers.  After leaving Wall Street, I began my career teaching Economics, Computer Applications and Web Programming. My interests in Web technology includes Systems Analysis, XML, PHP, JavaScript, database development and the business of technological innovation. In economics my interests include economic development, commodities market pricing and financial derivatives as well as international finance and trade.\r\nIn 2006, I co-authored my first book with noted author Patrick Carey, “New Perspectives on JavaScript Programming”. I am currently working on a series of economics books for the economics-non-major as well books on database design, statistical analysis of big data and the financial analysis of technological innovation.\r\nRealizing that economics and not technology was my passion, I went back for a PhD in Economics at Fordham University. I began in the Program in 2006 and graduated in May of 2015. It is while in this program I feel I really grew as a student, instructor and as a person. I was placed on academic probation twice and twice I came out stronger and better. What allowed me to be successful was realizing I needed to tab into a huge resource: my professors. When I did that I not was never on probation again. Had I done this sooner I really believe I would never have been on probation in the first place. Their insights and mentoring were a huge reason why I completed the Program.\r\nOn the lighter side of things, I live in Williston, Vermont. I also enjoy hunting, golf and playing chess. I love sports and I am an avid Mets fan. I also love the Yankees, Jets, Giants, the Islanders, the Rangers, the Nets and the Knicks.

Users can create reports by retrieving data to match a query name or identifier; create new worksheets for data entry; and post new data to a server. The new data may be brand new records; new names or identifiers for existing records; amendments to existing outward links and other updates.\r\n\r\nWe will start with an overview of the standardization process, then talk about the ginas system as an implementation of the new standards.

Users can create reports by retrieving data to match a query name or identifier; create new worksheets for data entry; and post new data to a server. The new data may be brand new records; new names or identifiers for existing records; amendments to existing outward links and other updates.\r\n\r\nWe will start with an overview of the standardization process, then talk about the ginas system as an implementation of the new standards.

Model deployment is the process of making a machine learning model available for generating predictions on new data, known as scoring (or sometimes called inferencing). The deployment used to present big difficulties, as models were typically built in one environment and needed to be deployed in a different one. Often they would need to be re-implemented in a new programming language, that would be very slow and error-prone.\r\nThis talk will cover two open standards that have made the process of model deployment easier: Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) and Portable Format for Analytics (PFA), both developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG). We'll also talk briefly about deployment options for deep learning models.\r\n","startsAt":"2018-09-15T13:45:00","endsAt":"2018-09-15T14:45:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":["01f67d55-1faa-461b-836f-c931a49a9164"],"categoryItems":[7545,7541],"questionAnswers":[],"roomId":2325,"format":"60 minutes","level":"200 (never stop learning)","timeslotId":1345,"link":"/sessions/#61632"},{"id":"62122","title":"\"Recalculating!\" - Navigating Container Technologies and Azure","description":"Like Boston streets at the height of the Big Dig, the world of containers can seem a tangle of construction and one-way streets.

There I developed financial models using the first IBM AT and XT computers.  After leaving Wall Street, I began my career teaching Economics, Computer Applications and Web Programming. My interests in Web technology includes Systems Analysis, XML, PHP, JavaScript, database development and the business of technological innovation. In economics my interests include economic development, commodities market pricing and financial derivatives as well as international finance and trade.\r\nIn 2006, I co-authored my first book with noted author Patrick Carey, “New Perspectives on JavaScript Programming”. I am currently working on a series of economics books for the economics-non-major as well books on database design, statistical analysis of big data and the financial analysis of technological innovation.\r\nRealizing that economics and not technology was my passion, I went back for a PhD in Economics at Fordham University. I began in the Program in 2006 and graduated in May of 2015. It is while in this program I feel I really grew as a student, instructor and as a person. I was placed on academic probation twice and twice I came out stronger and better. What allowed me to be successful was realizing I needed to tab into a huge resource: my professors. When I did that I not was never on probation again. Had I done this sooner I really believe I would never have been on probation in the first place. Their insights and mentoring were a huge reason why I completed the Program.\r\nOn the lighter side of things, I live in Williston, Vermont. I also enjoy hunting, golf and playing chess. I love sports and I am an avid Mets fan. I also love the Yankees, Jets, Giants, the Islanders, the Rangers, the Nets and the Knicks. You must be wondering how can I route for these combinations of teams? I just love sports and enjoy routing for my NY teams.
